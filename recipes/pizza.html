    <p>Recipe found at <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/neapolitan-pizza-3568216">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Let's get started!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons warm water (100 degrees F to 110 degrees F)</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing Cornmeal, for dusting</li>
        <li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes (preferably San Marzano) Kosher salt</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Torn fresh basil, for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Combine the warm water and yeast in a small bowl, stirring to dissolve the yeast. Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Add the yeast mixture to the flour and stir to make a shaggy dough. (The dough should be tacky. If it feels too wet and sticky, add flour, 1 tablespoon at a time; if it's too stiff, add a little water.) Transfer to a lightly oiled surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes. Place an inverted bowl over the dough and let rise slightly, 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and form each into a ball; arrange 3 inches apart on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Rub the tops of the dough lightly with olive oil and cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 hours before baking; let sit, covered, until ready to use. One hour before baking, put a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 500 degrees F (or 550 degrees F if your oven goes that high).</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Combine the tomatoes and their juices with 1 teaspoon salt in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Generously sprinkle a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet with cornmeal. Place 1 ball of dough upside down on the cornmeal using floured hands. Gently pull the dough into an 8- to 10-inch circle, reflouring your hands as needed and being careful not to deflate the dough. Spread about 1/4 cup tomato sauce on the crust; top with one-quarter of the mozzarella. Drizzle with 1 to 2 teaspoons olive oil and season with salt.</li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the hot stone and bake until the crust is dark golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle with basil. Let cool 2 minutes before slicing. Repeat to make 3 more pizzas.</li>
